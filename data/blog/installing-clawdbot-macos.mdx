# How to Install OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot/Moltbot) on macOS

OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot or Moltbot) is a powerful automation bot that helps streamline your workflow on macOS. This guide will walk you through the complete installation process, from prerequisites to verification.

<ServiceCallout />

## Prerequisites

Before installing ClawdBot, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Homebrew package manager
- At least 2GB of free disk space
- Administrator access to your Mac

## Step 1: Install Homebrew (If Not Already Installed)

Homebrew is the package manager we'll use to install dependencies. If you don't have it installed, open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, verify Homebrew is working:

```bash
brew --version
```

## Step 2: Install Python 3

While macOS comes with Python, we recommend installing the latest version via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python3
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see Python 3.8 or higher.

## Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

ClawdBot requires several system dependencies. Install them using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git curl wget openssl
```

## Step 4: Clone the ClawdBot Repository

Navigate to your desired installation directory and clone the repository:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/moltbot.git
cd moltbot
```

> Note: Replace the repository URL with the actual ClawdBot/Moltbot repository if different.

## Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` indicating the virtual environment is active.

## Step 6: Install ClawdBot

With the virtual environment activated, install ClawdBot and its dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If ClawdBot is available on PyPI, you can alternatively install it directly:

```bash
pip install clawdbot
```

## Step 7: Configure ClawdBot

Create a configuration file in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.clawdbot
cp config.example.yml ~/.clawdbot/config.yml
```

Edit the configuration file with your preferred text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.clawdbot/config.yml
```

Update the following settings:
- API keys (if required)
- Bot preferences
- Automation triggers
- Notification settings

## Step 8: Verify Installation

Test that ClawdBot is properly installed:

```bash
clawdbot --version
```

Run a test command to ensure everything works:

```bash
clawdbot test
```

## Step 9: Set Up Auto-Start (Optional)

To have ClawdBot start automatically when you log in, create a launch agent:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawdbot.plist
```

Add the following content (adjust paths as needed):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.clawdbot</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/moltbot/venv/bin/clawdbot</string>
        <string>start</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load the launch agent:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawdbot.plist
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Python Command Not Found

If `python3` is not recognized, add it to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors

Some operations might require elevated permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/Documents/moltbot
```

### Issue: SSL Certificate Errors

If you encounter SSL errors, update your certificates:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
/Applications/Python\ 3.*/Install\ Certificates.command
```

### Issue: Dependencies Conflict

If you have dependency conflicts, try creating a fresh virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Updating ClawdBot

To update ClawdBot to the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/moltbot
git pull origin main
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Uninstalling ClawdBot

If you need to uninstall ClawdBot:

1. Deactivate and remove the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
rm -rf ~/Documents/moltbot
```

2. Remove configuration files:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.clawdbot
```

3. Remove the launch agent (if configured):
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawdbot.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clawdbot.plist
```
