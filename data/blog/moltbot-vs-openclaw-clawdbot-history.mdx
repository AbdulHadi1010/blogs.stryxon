If you've searched for "Clawdbot installation" lately, you've probably seen three different names: **Clawdbot**, **Moltbot**, and **OpenClaw**. Are they different tools? Malware variants? Forks?

The short answer: **They're all the same AI agent**. The name changed twice due to trademark disputes and security concerns. Here's the full story.

<MainSiteCTA service="openclaw" />

## The Original Name: Clawdbot (June 2025 – December 2025)

Clawdbot launched in June 2025 as an open-source AI automation agent. The name was a playful reference to Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) + "bot", emphasizing its ability to execute terminal commands autonomously.

By December 2025, Clawdbot had:
- 15,000+ GitHub stars
- Installation guides for [Linux](/blog/installing-clawdbot-linux), [macOS](/blog/installing-clawdbot-macos), and [Windows](/blog/installing-clawdbot-windows)
- A thriving community of AI automation enthusiasts

**Then Anthropic's legal team got involved.**

## The First Rebrand: Moltbot (January 2026)

In early January 2026, Anthropic sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Clawdbot maintainers. The issue? The name "Clawdbot" was too similar to "Claude" and violated their trademark.

The maintainers scrambled to rebrand. On January 8, 2026, they announced the new name: **Moltbot**.

Why "Moltbot"? The name referenced molting—the process of shedding old skin for new growth. It was meant to symbolize the project's evolution beyond its Claude origins.

### The Moltbot Chaos (January 8 – February 8, 2026)

The rebrand created immediate problems:

1. **SEO Rankings Collapsed**: All Clawdbot tutorials and documentation pointed to old repos. Google searches returned outdated results.

2. **Package Name Confusion**: NPM packages, Docker images, and PyPI releases still used "clawdbot" internally. Users didn't know which version to install.

3. **Malware Surge**: Opportunistic attackers registered:
   - `moltbot-pro` (fake NPM package with 8,000 downloads)
   - `clawdbot-installer.exe` (Windows malware disguised as the legacy tool)
   - `moltbot-setup` Chrome extension (credential stealer)

By late January 2026, the Moltbot subreddit had 300+ posts asking: *"Is Moltbot safe? How do I know I'm installing the real version?"*

## The Final Name: OpenClaw (February 2026 – Present)

On February 8, 2026, the maintainers made a decisive move: **rebrand to OpenClaw** and establish clear security guidelines.

### Why "OpenClaw"?

- **Open**: Emphasizes the open-source nature (unlike proprietary Claude)
- **Claw**: Keeps the original "Claw" reference without trademark issues
- **Clear Branding**: The "Open" prefix (like OpenAI, OpenSSH) signals legitimacy

### What Changed with OpenClaw?

1. **Official Repository**: All code consolidated at `github.com/openclaw/openclaw`
2. **Verified Packages**: 
   - NPM: `@openclaw/cli`
   - Docker: `openclaw/agent`
   - PyPI: `openclaw`
3. **Security Checksums**: Every release includes SHA-256 hashes
4. **Domain Authority**: Official site at `openclaw.dev` (not `.com` or `.io`)

## Timeline: The Three Names

| Date | Name | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| June 2025 | **Clawdbot** | Deprecated | Original name, now redirects to OpenClaw |
| Jan 8, 2026 | **Moltbot** | Deprecated | Temporary rebrand, caused malware surge |
| Feb 8, 2026 | **OpenClaw** | **Active** | Current official name |

## How to Verify You Have the Real OpenClaw

During the transition, fake packages proliferated. Here's how to verify authenticity:

### ✅ Official Packages

```bash
# NPM (JavaScript/TypeScript)
npm install @openclaw/cli

# PyPI (Python)
pip install openclaw

# Docker
docker pull openclaw/agent:latest

# GitHub
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
```

### ❌ Fake Packages to Avoid

- `clawdbot-pro`
- `moltbot-installer`
- `openclaw-setup.exe` (OpenClaw doesn't distribute `.exe` files)
- Any package not from `@openclaw` scope on NPM

### Verify Checksums

Always check release hashes:

```bash
# Download the official release
wget https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/download/v2.1.0/openclaw-linux.tar.gz

# Verify SHA-256 checksum
sha256sum openclaw-linux.tar.gz
# Should match hash on release page
```

## What Happens to Old "Clawdbot" Installations?

If you installed Clawdbot before February 2026, it still works—but:

1. **No Security Updates**: The `clawdbot` package is archived and won't receive patches
2. **Breaking Changes**: Future AI model providers may drop support for legacy versions
3. **Community Support Ends**: All documentation now references OpenClaw

### Migration Command

Upgrade from Clawdbot/Moltbot to OpenClaw:

```bash
# Uninstall old versions
npm uninstall -g clawdbot moltbot

# Install OpenClaw
npm install -g @openclaw/cli

# Migrate config (preserves API keys)
openclaw migrate --from-clawdbot
```

Your existing `.clawdbot` config directory will be renamed to `.openclaw`, and all settings will transfer automatically.

## Why the Rebrand Matters for Users

Beyond the name confusion, this transition highlights a critical issue in the AI agent ecosystem: **supply chain security**.

When a popular tool rebrands, bad actors exploit the chaos:
- Fake packages with typosquatted names
- Malicious browser extensions claiming to be "official installers"
- Phishing sites that look identical to the real documentation

**The OpenClaw rebrand included security-first measures:**
- GPG-signed releases
- Verified Docker images (official Docker Hub org)
- NPM package scope (`@openclaw/`) prevents typosquatting
- HTTPS-only documentation with valid SSL certificates

## Summary: Clawdbot = Moltbot = OpenClaw

- **Clawdbot** (June 2025 – Dec 2025): Original name, forced to rebrand due to Anthropic trademark
- **Moltbot** (Jan 2026 – Feb 2026): Temporary name, caused malware surge and user confusion
- **OpenClaw** (Feb 2026 – Present): Final name with clear security guidelines

If you see any installation guides referencing "Clawdbot" or "Moltbot," they're outdated. Always install from:
- Official GitHub: `github.com/openclaw/openclaw`
- NPM scope: `@openclaw/cli`
- Docker Hub: `openclaw/agent`
